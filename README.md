## About The Project

In recent years, many companies have opted to pursue digital transformation in order to improve their efficiency. One key technology used is IoT â€“ which can monitor equipment status, to allow for preventive maintenance. This has led to more dynamic scheduling of maintenance.

Equipment Maintenance Management Automation, or EMMA, seeks to streamline the process of managing and scheduling equipment maintanences by providing a platform to keep track of maintenance, equipment and inventory details. It can also integrate with IoT sensors to auto-schedule maintenance.
